> The open-source worksheets platform for early education

I believe in an open-source education.

The focus of this app is to build the easiest way for parents to create, personalize and print worksheets for their children â€” for _free_. I use web technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) to make customization more creative and streamlined than ever before.

Safety is paramount when it comes to children's education. That's why this app remains open-source and free to use, and while paid features might be added later one, they will also remain open-source.
